## 7.3 Monitoring and Analytics

Real-time performance monitoring tracks four critical metrics where **Cache hit rates** represent the percentage of patterns served from cache versus total compilation requests, indicating cache effectiveness and pattern reuse frequency (90.9% for both strategies showing excellent utilization); **Pattern compilation times** measure the computational duration required to transform SQL patterns into executable finite state automata, revealing optimization opportunities for complex patterns with high compilation overhead; **Memory usage** tracks total system consumption including baseline operation and cache-induced overhead, ensuring resource efficiency (LRU's 0.21 MB increase vs 1.90 MB baseline demonstrates optimal balance); and **Query execution times** capture end-to-end performance from SQL parsing through result delivery, providing the ultimate measure of user-facing responsiveness and optimization effectiveness (LRU's 3.433s vs FIFO's 4.009s proves intelligent eviction policies successfully translate cache efficiency into measurable performance gains).
