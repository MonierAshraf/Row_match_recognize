• Comprehensive Test Coverage:
While you have tests in tests/test_ast.py and tests/test_parser.py, ensure these tests cover a wide range of scenarios—including edge cases such as:

Empty matches and unmatched rows in the MATCH_RECOGNIZE clause.
Complex pattern expressions with nested functions or unconventional whitespace.
Error conditions where clauses are missing or incorrectly formed.
This will help verify that every aspect of your parsing and AST generation behaves as expected.
