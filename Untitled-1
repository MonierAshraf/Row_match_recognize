• Comprehensive Test Coverage:
While you have tests in tests/test_ast.py and tests/test_parser.py, ensure these tests cover a wide range of scenarios—including edge cases such as:

Empty matches and unmatched rows in the MATCH_RECOGNIZE clause.
Complex pattern expressions with nested functions or unconventional whitespace.
Error conditions where clauses are missing or incorrectly formed.
This will help verify that every aspect of your parsing and AST generation behaves as expected.




• Enhanced Error Handling:
Consider enhancing error messages with more context (perhaps by including the exact token or position where parsing fails) and using these errors consistently across all modules.


 Type Annotations and Use of Modern Python Features:
Although you already have some type hints, you could leverage Python’s dataclasses for your AST node definitions. This can reduce boilerplate code and make your classes even more concise and self-documenting.

• Regex and String Processing:
The use of regex in functions like smart_split and in the PatternClause is clever; however, ensure that these regexes cover all complex cases in SQL expressions. Adding unit tests specifically targeting these functions would be beneficial.
