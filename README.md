# My MATCH_RECOGNIZE Project

This project demonstrates how to parse SQL queries that include a MATCH_RECOGNIZE clause.  
The project is organized into several folders:
- **grammar**: Contains ANTLR-generated files.
- **parser**: Contains all parsing code (tokenization, ANTLR integration, expression & pattern parsing).
- **ast**: Contains AST definitions and builder code.
- **validator**: Contains semantic and structural validation logic.
- **tests**: Unit tests for each component.

See `main.py` for a usage example.

General function call parsing (for aggregates, classifier, match_number),
Further semantic checks for aggregate 
function arguments to ensure they do not contain nested navigation functions,

Full support for reluctant quantifiers and proper exclusion syntax,
And possibly more detailed modeling of unmatched row semantics.

now can recheck again and told me if any thing missing ?

General Function Call Parsing:
Our current expression parser is focused on navigation and basic arithmetic. It does not yet support general function calls (like aggregate functions such as avg(), count(), classifier(), or match_number()). Full support for these would include parsing their arguments and representing them as function call AST nodes.



Additional Aggregate Function Validation:
While we validate that multiple aggregate arguments refer to the same pattern variable, we do not yet check that aggregate function arguments do not include any pattern navigation functions. The documentation requires that aggregate function arguments must not contain navigation functions, and this check should be added.

based on requirements was sent before ,is parser and AST meet this rquirments well in details ? 

Enhanced Quantifier and Exclusion Syntax:

Reluctant Quantifiers:
Our pattern parser supports greedy quantifiers (like +, *, ?, and {m,n}) but does not yet support the reluctant form (e.g. +? or {3,5}?).
Exclusion Syntax:
The documentation describes exclusion syntax using a format like {- row_pattern -}. Our current implementation uses a simple ^ operator for exclusions. Supporting the full syntax would require extending the pattern tokenizer and parser accordingly.



Unmatched Row Handling & Detailed Output Semantics:
Although we capture the rows_per_match and after_match_skip options and flag empty matches, the nuances of handling unmatched rows (especially with options like ALL ROWS PER MATCH WITH UNMATCHED ROWS) aren’t modeled in our AST or validation phase. That behavior is typically part of the evaluation phase—but it might be useful to represent these options more explicitly in the AST.







Evaluation Engine:
• Our work here focuses on parsing and AST construction plus semantic validation. A complete evaluation engine would be needed to fully implement running vs. final semantics during match evaluation, compute measures, and handle unmatched rows dynamically. This is typically a separate phase beyond parsing/AST building.





Option 3: Evaluation engine improvements first (implement explicit RUNNING vs FINAL semantics, optimize pattern matching performance, expand edge-case testing)
 Clearly implement distinct running and final semantics in measure evaluation.
 Optimize pattern matching via automata (optional, recommended for efficiency).
 Extend testing for edge cases and larger datasets for performance validation.








Priority	Task
🔥 High	Improve nested function parsing and grammar restrictions
🔥 High	Enhance validation error clarity and coverage
⚙️ Medium	Implement explicit RUNNING vs. FINAL semantics
⚙️ Medium	Extend testing for robustness
🚀 Optional	Automata-based optimization

Run Tests: Write automated tests to verify that all clauses are being parsed correctly, especially edge cases like missing or malformed clauses.
