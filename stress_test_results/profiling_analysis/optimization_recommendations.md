# Row Match Recognize Performance Optimization Recommendations

Based on profiling analysis, the following optimizations are recommended:

## High Impact Optimizations

### matcher.match

**Finding:** Pattern matching consumes 50.0% of execution time

**Recommendation:** Review the core matching algorithm for optimization opportunities. Consider specialized algorithms for common pattern types.

### pattern_tokenizer.tokenize_pattern

**Finding:** Pattern tokenization consumes 25.0% of execution time

**Recommendation:** Consider implementing a more efficient tokenization algorithm or caching tokenized patterns.

### automata.NFABuilder.build_nfa

**Finding:** NFA construction consumes 15.0% of execution time

**Recommendation:** Optimize NFA construction algorithm or cache NFAs for similar patterns.

### matcher

**Finding:** Module consumes 50.0% of execution time

**Recommendation:** Focus optimization efforts on the matcher module.
