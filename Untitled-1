Ensure that any column references in MEASURES or navigation functions (like PREV, NEXT) are present in the DataFrame schema.
Function Usage Validation:

Extend validations for functions beyond COUNT() to cover FIRST(), LAST(), PREV(), NEXT(), etc.




Overall Assessment and Recommendations
Readability of AST:
Your improvements in the RowsPerMatchClause.__repr__ method provide a clearer, human‐readable output (with spaces between words) when printing the AST. This is a significant usability improvement.

Requirement Coverage:
All major subclauses of MATCH_RECOGNIZE—PARTITION BY, ORDER BY, MEASURES, ROWS PER MATCH (with its various modifiers), AFTER MATCH SKIP, PATTERN, SUBSET, and DEFINE—are being parsed and represented as AST nodes. Special functions (classifier, match number, logical/physical navigation, aggregates) and the running/final semantics are handled per the specification.

Validation:
Your code validates that each identifier in DEFINE is found in the pattern variables and that the functions in the measure expressions are used correctly. This helps catch mismatches and incorrect usage early.

Potential Enhancements:

Error Messages: You might consider refining error messages to include suggestions (e.g. if a classifier function is used with an argument that isn’t found in the pattern, hint at using a valid pattern variable).
Testing Edge Cases: Additional tests might be added to cover nested functions and combinations (e.g. nested navigation functions, aggregates with classifier arguments, etc.), but the logs already show a good coverage of the key cases.
