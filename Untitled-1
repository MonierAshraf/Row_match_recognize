Once you are confident that the AST is constructed correctly, the next phase is to write a translator that converts this AST into a sequence of pandas DataFrame operations (such as filtering, grouping, aggregating, etc.).
You can further improve error recovery and performance by integrating ANTLR’s error listeners and optimizing the parsing process.

Implementing the additional validations, richer metadata, error recovery strategies, and performance optimization

Further Cross‑Clause Validations:

Validate that the columns in the ORDER BY clause exist in the DataFrame.
Ensure that any column references in MEASURES or navigation functions (like PREV, NEXT) are present in the DataFrame schema.
Function Usage Validation:

Extend validations for functions beyond COUNT() to cover FIRST(), LAST(), PREV(), NEXT(), etc.
Consider building a mapping of allowed functions and their argument patterns to catch usage errors early.
