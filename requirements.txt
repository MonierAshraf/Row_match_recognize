Putting It All Together
The full production‑ready module now includes:

A robust expression parser (parse_expression_full).
An advanced pattern parser with subset expansion (AdvancedPatternVisitor in parse_pattern_full).
A stub for pattern optimization (optimize_pattern).
Deep semantic validation in the AST builder.
Clear integration points for further enhancements (detailed expression sub‑ASTs, further pattern optimizations, and semantic validations).

can rebuild ast_builder.py and return full code of files that updated 



ok , we can go forward in pipeline stages with AST Builder by using the parse trees produced by the parser to build your raw AST 
aslo will share with old version of implementation we can also make some updates and apply refelctoring to make AST module as we targeted on pipeline.

pipeline we following is 
SQL Query → Parser (using parser_util and others) → Parse Tree  
Parse Tree → AST Builder → Raw AST  
Raw AST → NFA/DFA Module → Pattern Matching  
Pattern Matching → Optimizer → Optimized AST  
Optimized AST → Validator → Validated AST  
Validated AST → Executor → Results




Since the parser stage is now robustly covered by our tests, you can confidently move forward with integrating the subsequent pipeline stages:

AST Builder:
Use the parse trees produced by the parser to build your raw AST.
NFA/DFA Module:
Convert the raw AST for pattern matching into a corresponding automaton.
Pattern Matching & Optimizer:
Run optimizations on the AST to improve matching performance.
Validator:
Validate the final AST to ensure correctness before execution.
Executor:
Execute the validated AST against your dataset.
This modular approach with thorough testing at the parser level minimizes the risk of errors when integrating later stages.

If you need further test cases or help with the integration of the next stages (e.g., AST building), just
