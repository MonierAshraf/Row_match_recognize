Putting It All Together
The full production‑ready module now includes:

A robust expression parser (parse_expression_full).
An advanced pattern parser with subset expansion (AdvancedPatternVisitor in parse_pattern_full).
A stub for pattern optimization (optimize_pattern).
Deep semantic validation in the AST builder.
Clear integration points for further enhancements (detailed expression sub‑ASTs, further pattern optimizations, and semantic validations).
