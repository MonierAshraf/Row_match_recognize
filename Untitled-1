• Comprehensive Test Coverage:
While you have tests in tests/test_ast.py and tests/test_parser.py, ensure these tests cover a wide range of scenarios—including edge cases such as:

Empty matches and unmatched rows in the MATCH_RECOGNIZE clause.
Complex pattern expressions with nested functions or unconventional whitespace.
Error conditions where clauses are missing or incorrectly formed.
This will help verify that every aspect of your parsing and AST generation behaves as expected.

Summary of Enhancements
Token Cleanup: Enhance regex to capture all pattern constructs and clean tokens more thoroughly.
Error Reporting: Improve error messages with more context and consider structured logging.
Code Modularity: Split functionality into dedicated modules and add comprehensive unit tests.
Additional Validations: Add checks for exclusion syntax, grouping, and consistency of navigation/aggregate function arguments.
SELECT Clause Parsing: Integrate a more robust parser for the SELECT clause and provide detailed error messages.
Documentation: Enrich code comments and provide usage examples.




Areas That Need More Work:

Empty Match Semantics: Our implementation has issues generating proper empty matches with the ? quantifier. This needs to be fixed in the matcher core logic.

PERMUTE Testing: While PERMUTE is implemented, our test suggests it needs to be verified more thoroughly with different combinations.

ALL ROWS PER MATCH Modifiers: We need to finalize testing for:
ALL ROWS PER MATCH SHOW EMPTY MATCHES
ALL ROWS PER MATCH OMIT EMPTY MATCHES
ALL ROWS PER MATCH WITH UNMATCHED ROWS
Pattern Exclusion Syntax: The {- pattern -} exclusion syntax is mentioned but not thoroughly tested yet.



SUBSET/Union Variables: We've implemented basic support but need more testing scenarios.



CLASSIFIER Function: The spec mentions the CLASSIFIER() function, which returns the pattern variable associated with a row. This doesn't appear to be fully implemented yet.

Pattern Exclusion Syntax: The {- pattern -} syntax for excluding parts of a match from output with ALL ROWS PER MATCH isn't evident in the implementation.

Nested Navigation Functions: While there's code to support nested functions like PREV(FIRST(A.val)), the debug output doesn't show this being used, so additional testing might be needed.

PERMUTE Syntax: The specification mentions PERMUTE(A, B, C) for matching components in any order, which might need implementation or testing.

Pattern Anchors: The ^ and $ anchors for matching at partition start/end should be verified.

Row Pattern Count Aggregation: Special syntax like count(A.*) for counting rows matched to a specific variable might need verification.

Edge Cases:

Empty matches handling needs verification
WITH UNMATCHED ROWS option needs testing
