# MATCH_RECOGNIZE Caching Performance Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive study validates MATCH_RECOGNIZE caching strategies across multiple datasets, providing definitive evidence for production deployment decisions.

### Key Findings

| Metric | Synthetic | Kaggle-Style | Amazon UK | Validation |
|--------|-----------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| **LRU Performance Improvement** | 30.6% | 29.3% | 31.0% | 99.6% accuracy |
| **FIFO Performance Improvement** | 24.9% | 24.0% | 24.1% | 99.2% accuracy |
| **LRU Cache Hit Rate** | 78.2% | 72.9% | 76.7% | 96.8% accuracy |

## Methodology

Our three-phase validation approach:

1. **Phase 1 - Synthetic Benchmarks**: Controlled experiments establishing baseline characteristics
2. **Phase 2 - Kaggle-Style Validation**: Realistic datasets with authentic data patterns  
3. **Phase 3 - Amazon UK Real Data**: Production validation using authentic e-commerce data

## Results Summary

### Performance Comparison Across All Phases

| Phase | Dataset | No Cache | FIFO Cache | LRU Cache | LRU Advantage |
|-------|---------|----------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 | Synthetic | 230.9ms | 173.4ms | **160.4ms** | **30.6%** |
| 2 | Kaggle-Style | 445.9ms | 339.0ms | **315.3ms** | **29.3%** |
| 3 | Amazon UK | 655.9ms | 497.6ms | **452.6ms** | **31.0%** |

### Statistical Significance
