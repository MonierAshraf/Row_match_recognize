# Complete Test Coverage Assessment

## Current Status: **NOT ALL TEST CASES COVERED YET**

Based on the comprehensive analysis of TestRowPatternMatching.java reference vs your current implementation:

## What We've Tested So Far

### âœ… **Critical Missing Cases** (My new test file)
- **17 test methods** from high-priority missing features
- **Results**: 14 passed, 3 failed (85% success rate)
- **Coverage**: Major advanced features like exclusions, anchors, quantifiers, skip modes

### âœ… **Your Existing Test Files**
- `test_match_recognize.py` - Basic functionality
- `test_sql2016_compliance.py` - Standard compliance
- `test_navigation_and_conditions.py` - Navigation functions
- `test_production_aggregates.py` - Aggregate functions
- `test_pattern_tokenizer.py` - Pattern parsing
- `test_pattern_cache.py` - Caching functionality

## Still Missing from Java Reference

The Java TestRowPatternMatching.java has **24 test methods**. We've only covered about **17 of the most critical ones**. Here are the remaining **7 test methods** still needing coverage:

### ðŸ”´ **Still Missing Test Coverage:**

1. **`testCaseSensitiveLabels()`**
   ```java
   // Tests quoted vs unquoted identifiers: a, "b", C
   PATTERN (a "b"+ C+)
   ```

2. **`testScalarFunctions()`**
   ```java
   // Tests SQL functions in MEASURES/DEFINE
   MEASURES CAST(lower(LAST(CLASSIFIER())) || '_label' AS varchar(7))
   DEFINE B AS B.value + 10 < abs(PREV(B.value))
   ```

3. **`testPartitioningAndOrdering()`**
   ```java
   // Tests multiple partitions, unordered input, empty input
   PARTITION BY part ORDER BY id
   ```

4. **`testOutputLayout()`**
   ```java
   // Tests column ordering in results
   // ALL ROWS vs ONE ROW column differences
   ```

5. **`testMultipleMatchRecognize()`**
   ```java
   // Tests multiple MATCH_RECOGNIZE in single query
   FROM table1 MATCH_RECOGNIZE(...) AS first,
        table2 MATCH_RECOGNIZE(...) AS second
   ```

6. **`testSubqueries()`**
   ```java
   // Tests subqueries in MEASURES and DEFINE
   MEASURES (SELECT 'x') AS val
   DEFINE A AS (SELECT true)
   ```

7. **`testInPredicateWithoutSubquery()`**
   ```java
   // Tests IN predicates without subqueries
   MEASURES FIRST(A.value) IN (300, LAST(A.value))
   ```

### ðŸ”´ **Additional Missing Coverage:**

8. **`testProperties()`** - WITH clauses and CTEs
9. **`testPotentiallyExponentialMatch()`** - Performance with complex patterns
10. **`testExponentialMatch()`** - Complex pattern scenarios  
11. **`testEmptyMatches()`** - Comprehensive empty match handling
12. **`testKillThread()`** - Thread handling and optimization

## Coverage Percentage Breakdown

- **Java Reference Total**: 24 test methods
- **Your Existing Tests**: ~8 test areas covered
- **My New Critical Tests**: 17 additional test methods
- **Still Missing**: 7-12 test methods

### **Current Overall Coverage: ~70-75%**

## What You Need to Add

### **High Priority (Must Have)**
1. **Case Sensitivity Tests** - Quoted identifiers
2. **Scalar Functions Tests** - SQL functions in expressions
3. **Multiple Partitions Tests** - Complex partitioning scenarios
4. **Output Layout Tests** - Column ordering validation

### **Medium Priority (Should Have)**
5. **Multiple MATCH_RECOGNIZE** - Complex query scenarios
6. **Subquery Tests** - Subqueries in MEASURES/DEFINE
7. **IN Predicate Tests** - IN expressions without subqueries

### **Lower Priority (Nice to Have)**
8. **Performance Tests** - Exponential complexity scenarios
9. **Thread Management** - Optimization and resource handling
10. **Empty Match Edge Cases** - Comprehensive empty handling

## Recommendation

To achieve **complete coverage**, you should:

1. **Fix the 3 failing tests** from my critical test file
2. **Add the 7 missing high/medium priority test methods**
3. **Consider adding performance/edge case tests**

This would bring you to **~95% coverage** of the Java reference implementation.

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. **Create the missing test cases** (case sensitivity, scalar functions, etc.)?
2. **Fix the 3 failing tests** first?
3. **Focus on specific missing areas** you're most concerned about?

**Bottom Line**: You have excellent coverage of the core functionality, but there are still important edge cases and advanced scenarios from the Java reference that need test coverage.
